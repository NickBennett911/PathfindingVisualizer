# PathfindingVisualizer
Short weekend project where I decided to task myself on learning how to better use the pathfinding algorithms A* and Breadth-First Search.


Run Main.py to run visualizer

pre-requisites:
- make sure you have pygame installed and referenced properly in the project's space
- make sure you have python installed on your machine
